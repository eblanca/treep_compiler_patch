Patch file for TreeP
====================

This repository offers a patch file which makes TreeP buildable on modern
linux systems (tested on debian, mint and several ubuntu flavors).

TreeP is a programming language designed and written by Frank Sinapsi, and he
used it to develop some interesting applications: most people will already know
Avinaptic (which creates detailed reports out of video clips, encoded in
any format and streamed in any container you like) but also others.

The provided TreeP package ships with full source code for both compiler and
run-time libraries BUT today it does not build as-is anymore (latest release
dates 2012) because some libraries it needs had changed a bit (most noticeably
opencv and ffmpeg libs). Now, this means it may be tricky to get any
applications written in TreeP compile and run.

This is where this patch comes into play, as it updates some included headers
and macros in order to build the whole compiler suite successfully. Then, you
will be able to compile your preferred applications written in TreeP.


Usage:
------
Download TreeP source package (trp-20120628.zip) from Sinapsi's web site and
unpack it. Then download this patch and run:
cd trp-20120628/
patch -i <patch_file> -p1

Now, open 00leggimi and follow the instructions to build the whole compiler
suite.


Questions & Answers:
--------------------

Q: Will it make TreeP buildable on my *** distribution/OS?
A: I don't know, just try. Just, if you like helping other people, please
   report here your achievements, WHATEVER they are (success/failure).

Q: Did you update/fix the compiler?
A: No, I didn't, this patch ONLY makes the source code buildable. I am not
   aware of bugs neither into the compiler, nor into the libraries.

Q: Will you update the source code for Sinapsi's applications also?
A: They don't need any updates. Once you have the compiler, then they will
   build and run just fine (this is my feedback with Avinaptic, which I
   actually use very often).
   Not to mention, I don't know TreeP at all.

Q: Will you provide updated Windows executables?
A: No, I won't. I don't use Windows currently and I won't setup a VM just for
   building a compiler I don't need. Sinapsi already provides executables for
   his applications written in TreeP on the web site, they should still work.
   MS Windows is all about backward compatibility.

Q: The source code for TreeP is under GPL-v3 license, so you can host the whole
   updated source code into your own repository, instead of having to download
   the original source package and then patch it.
   Wouldn't it be easier this way?
A: I'm just too lazy.
